# First Slice - Order Platform Integration Game

## Game Objective
Demonstrate the agility of story slicing and incremental delivery by implementing an order processing system for a fictional company.

This is a gamified version of the Elephant Carpaccio exercise, with unashamedly time pressure and the need for more software development. However, the principles remain the same: early and often release of value.

## General Requirements

- Accept orders in JSON format.

## Points System

## Order Distribution
